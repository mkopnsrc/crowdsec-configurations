# crowdsec-notifications-discord
This is custom Crowdsec Notification config for Discord using Webhook

I'm currently utilizing this discord notification plugin with my OPNsense Firewall where I have crowdsec plugin installed and to send discord notification whenever crowdsec blocks the attacker based on my configuerd bouncers.
